# lc-3-py

LC-3 simulator written in Python as a learning exercise, following this [guide](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm) by @justinmeiners and @rpendleton.

I also copied the trap implementations, as well as the getch and sign extend code from [this](https://github.com/mhashim6/LC3-Virtual-Machine) Python implementation by @mhashim6.
